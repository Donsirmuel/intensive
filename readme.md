## Features
- **Score Input**: Enter individual or multiple scores to evaluate.
- **Custom Grading Scales**: Define your own grading thresholds (e.g., A = 90-100, B = 80-89, etc.).
- **Instant Results**: Get real-time grade calculations as you input scores.
- **Export Options**: Save results as a text file, CSV, or PDF (optional feature).
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple design for quick and easy use.

### Notes:
- **Customization**: Replace placeholders like `username` in the GitHub URL, email, or specific features with your actual details.
- **Language**: I assumed Python, but if you're using another language (e.g., JavaScript, Java), let me know, and I’ll tweak the instructions.
- **Features**: If your app has unique functionalities (e.g., a GUI, database integration), tell me, and I’ll update the README accordingly.

Let me know if you'd like adjustments!
